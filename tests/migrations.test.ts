/**
 * Migration safety net. D1 migrations are forward-only and are applied straight
 * against staging/production at deploy time, so a syntax error, bad ordering, or
 * schema drift is otherwise caught only in prod. These tests apply every
 * migration from an empty database to a real SQLite engine (node:sqlite) — the
 * engine family D1 is built on. This proves the SQL is well-formed SQLite and
 * the schema is coherent; it approximates but does not perfectly replicate D1's
 * exact dialect.
 *
 * SQL is loaded via Vite's raw glob (not node:fs) so the test type-checks under
 * the Workers tsconfig; node:sqlite is typed by tests/node-sqlite.d.ts.
