/**
 * Storage for post-merge deployments.
 *
 * The `deployments` row *is* the lease. Two properties of this module are load
 * bearing and neither is visible from a casual read of the SQL:
 *
 * 1. {@link insertDeployment} never checks before it inserts. The unique index
 *    `ux_deployments_attempt` is the mutual exclusion — see the comment on that
 *    function before "simplifying" it into a SELECT-then-INSERT.
 * 2. {@link claimDeployment} is a single conditional UPDATE, so two consumers
 *    racing the same row cannot both win. It is the *only* place a stale
 *    `running` row is reclaimed, and only the deploy consumer may call it.
 *
 * Every timestamp is an application-written ISO 8601 string, canonicalised to
 * UTC with a millisecond fraction by {@link resolveTimestamp} before it is
 * bound. These columns are compared as TEXT, so a column holding more than one
 * spelling of an instant sorts by bytes rather than by time: `datetime('now')`
 * produces `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, which sorts before the ISO form (' ' 0x20 <
 * 'T' 0x54) and is rejected outright, while an offset or fraction-less ISO form
 * is accepted and rewritten. Either would break `lease_expires_at`, which is
 * range-compared on the claim path — stranding a deployment forever or letting a
 * consumer reclaim a live one and deploy the same commit twice — and
 * `created_at`, which decides which of two merges publishes over the other. See
 * `migrations/042_api_tokens.sql`.
 *
 * Every query is scoped on `project_id` and never on the bare `project` name:
 * names are not globally unique, so matching on one crosses tenants (see
 * `webhookBelongsToProject` in `./webhooks.ts`).
