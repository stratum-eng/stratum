/**
 * Runs post-merge deployments: one queue message in, terminal `deployments`
 * rows out.
 *
 * Four properties of this module are load bearing.
 *
 * **The tree is read once, at the pinned merge commit, and the policy is parsed
 * out of those same bytes.** `loadPolicy` takes a branch, not a ref, so using it
 * here would let a *newer* policy apply to an *older* tree: land a benign
 * change, land a policy change, and the first change's still-queued deploy picks
 * up the second policy. Reading at the commit makes config and code provably one
 * commit, and costs nothing extra because the files are what gets uploaded.
 *
 * **`skipped` means exactly one thing: no deploy was configured.** A missing
 * secret, an unset `DEPLOY_SECRET_KEY`, an undecryptable value, an unreadable
 * tree, a rejected `deploys:` entry, a provider error — every one of those is
 * `failed` with a reason naming the cause. Reporting an operator error as a calm
 * grey state is failing open on something that stops production updating.
 *
 * **Everything is scoped on `projectId`, and a message without one is refused.**
 * Project names are not globally unique, so resolving one by name would hand a
 * deploy another tenant's credentials (see `webhookBelongsToProject`).
 *
 * **Every path that claims a row writes a terminal status in a `finally`.** A
 * row left `running` with no lease is a deployment nobody finishes and nobody
 * can retry.
 *
 * `readFiles`, `now` and `fetch` are injected for the reason `SandboxEvaluator`
 * injects its own seams: without them, testing any of the above needs a real git
 * remote, a real clock, and a real provider account.
