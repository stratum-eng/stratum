/**
 * The nineteen tools the MCP server exposes.
 *
 * The full agent contribution loop: read a project, fork a workspace, commit,
 * open an evaluation-gated change, follow it through review to merge, and track
 * issues. Every one is a call into the REST API through `StratumClient`, so
 * Stratum's governance invariants hold over MCP exactly as they do over HTTP —
 * a change cannot merge past failing evaluators, agent tokens cannot submit
 * review verdicts at all, and every merged change keeps its provenance and cost
 * records. The protocol is a doorway, not a bypass.
 *
 * Tool DESCRIPTIONS are the only documentation a model gets, so they state the
 * refusals as well as the capabilities: a model that knows `stratum_review_change`
 * will reject its agent token asks a human instead of retrying nineteen times.
 *
 * The billing surface is READ-ONLY and stays that way. `stratum_get_usage`
 * exists because an agent that can see 12% of its allowance left batches its
 * changes, moves the project to its own provider key, or stops and asks its
 * human — where an agent that cannot see it discovers the limit by hitting a
 * wall. There is deliberately no upgrade, top-up or payment-method tool, and no
 * `stratum_set_provider_key`: a limit an agent can raise is not a limit, and a
 * credential must never pass through a model's context window (PRD §4c). Both
 * refusals are stated in `stratum_get_usage`'s own description so a model reads
 * them where it would otherwise go looking.
