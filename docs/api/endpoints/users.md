# Users API

## Get Current User
`GET /api/users`

Returns the authenticated user's profile.

## Delete Account
`DELETE /api/users/me`

GDPR-grade account erasure. Deletes the caller's account and **all** owned
projects, revokes all tokens/sessions (and the user's agents), and **anonymizes**
the user's contributions to *other* people's projects (author set to a
`deleted-user` tombstone — the contribution stays, the identity is removed).
Requires confirmation with the caller's own username:

```json
{ "confirm": "<your-username>" }
```

Setting deletion **immediately invalidates the caller's credentials** (subsequent
requests return `401`). Returns `202 Accepted` with
`{ "status": "deleting", "jobId": "del_…" }`; the cascade runs asynchronously and
always completes (org sole-ownership is auto-resolved, never blocking erasure). A
mismatched `confirm` returns `400`.
